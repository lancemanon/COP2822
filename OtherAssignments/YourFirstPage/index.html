        <p>
            My name is Taylor, and one of my <em>favorite</em> hobbies is playing <b>video games</b>. Each year I attempt to play as many new games as possible while
            maintaining a social life and keeping up with my responsibilities, including but not limited to schoolwork and actual work. As you can 
            imagine, this is a difficult task as the amount of new games released each year continues to grow.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On top of that hobby, I am also a bit of a cinefile, so among the hours of video games, I am also trying to watch as many new movies as 
            possible. I enjoy going to the movies by myself, getting a snack and a drink, and watching anywhere between 1-3 new releases depending 
            on my schedule. If there is a gap between movies, I'll either get some food <small>(a real meal instead of popcorn)</small>, or I'll do some <strong>reading</strong> on
            an ereader.
        </p>

            I am currently attending Valencia College, which you can view by following the link <a href="https://valenciacollege.edu">HERE</a>.
